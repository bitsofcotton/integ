# integ
Solve PDE functions.

# Rough sketch
With goki_check_cc:lieonn.hh:filter condition, a piecewise continuous functions' (especially for f(x)) integrate/differential can be written in f(x,dx) algebraic ones.
So if condition satisfies, any PDEs can be written in their form.

With randtools on PDE, we conclude tan \<a,\[x,dx\]\>(... x_k ... dx_k ...)^m -\> epsilon for their solution.

After doing them, with matrix-matrix log/exp can describe the series better with super geometry functions.

After doing them all, we can get some root functions f\_0(x,dx), ... as g(f\_0(x,dx),...) as a solution, so reverting such dx variable by first ones, we can get whole solution if they are proved only exists.

# There's another methods
We can use super boxel methods to do this with surface condition nonlinear fit to the unique boxel and diff/integrate matrices.
We don't use them.

# i/o format
We input PDEs with super geometric series form and surface conditions.
The output format is obscure.
