With randtools on PDE with goki.hh:filter analytic funciton, we conclude
f(tan \<x,a(\partial/\partial x_k)\>(\partial/\partial x_k...)^m) -\> epsilon. for f's PDE.
There exists which is larger chase on PDE definition and PDE solution, however,
if we can provide first floor description on given PDE and they doesn't include aleph_1 or more
(only include the abs infimum omega^k, k\<omega), weak solution gained with some of the
measurable condition.
