Solve PDE functions.

# Description
Stub.

With randtools on PDE with goki.hh:filter analytic funciton, we conclude
f(tan \<x,a(\partial/\partial x_k)\>(\partial/\partial x_k...)^m) -\> epsilon. for f's PDE.
There exists which is larger chase on PDE definition and PDE solution, however,
if we can provide first floor description on given PDE and they doesn't include aleph_1 or more
(only include the abs infimum omega^k, k\<omega), weak solution gained with some of the
measurable condition.

# Tips
There also exists only finite edge or each edge condition of the well analysed functions to be solution.

This is done by dividing invariant by some combination.

So another problem is s.t. finite combination on object of each-dimension.
This might causes trajectory related problem.
